 <h1>The Fool in a time-based position</h1>
<p>
    The Fool in the Past position could represent a time in the past 
    where you could have taken another route and ended up somewhere different 
    than where you are now. It could also mean that you have already set things 
    into motion that will produce a new path for the person in question.  
    It can also represent time wasted.
